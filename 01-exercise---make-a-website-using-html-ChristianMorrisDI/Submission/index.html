    <h1>Welcome to my website about my pet Puffer fish.</h1>
    <p>Puffer Fish are one of the most exotic and dangerous pets to keep in the world. My Puffer fish was caught as a
        baby at 1cm in length in the Nile River in Egypt and flown via airplane to New Zealand! Today we will explore a
        little bit more about this weird fish.</p>
    <h2>Interesting facts!</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Nile river puffers are also known as the Fahaka Puffer.</li>
        <li>They can live in partly salted or fresh water.</li>
        <li>The Fahaka Puffer has a beak instead of teeth to bite through shells and snails.</li>
        <li>He may reach up to 1.4 Feet in length!</li>
    </ul>
